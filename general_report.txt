This report will contain the data for the various tests conducted in each
scheduling scheme.  The default scheduler will be entitled: "Control".  Timing
was conducted with the "time" command, and was run in a bash script.  The script
used while building the report can be found on the associated GitHub repository.

Control:
(1)	0.11 real	0.01 user	0.10 sys
(2)	0.10 real	0.01 user	0.06 sys
(3)	0.10 real	0.00 user	0.08 sys

Unfair:
(1)	0.21 real	0.03 user	0.11 sys
(2)	0.11 real	0.01 user	0.10 sys
(3)	0.10 real	0.00 user	0.10 sys

Adaptive:
(1)	0.10 real	0.01 user	0.00 sys
(2)	2.70 real	0.00 user	0.00 sys
(3)	0.23 real	0.01 user	0.00 sys

	Note: Adaptive scheduling felt noticably longer to run than previous
	      tests (namely, Unfair and the Control).

	      Additionally, sometimes, various user processes will appear to
              hang for several seconds before running normally.  This is not 
	      an overly-frequent phenomenon, and thus it is a bit jarring when
	      it occurs.
